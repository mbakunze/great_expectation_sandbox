A tiny great_expectation sandbox example for a blog post :)

### get the thing running

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Then in the repo, run `poetry install` 
and you should be ready to go. Start the notebook with `poetry tun jupyter notebook ge_sandvox.ipynb` 
or simply play around with the `great_expection` CLI.
